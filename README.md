# Dynamic-Vision
Dynamic Vision is a fictitious company that I designed a landing page for which I then coded. The website incorporates a unique "Broken layout" where elements overlap. Site is fully responsive.

TODO: 
  1. Host on heroku
  2. Improve hover effects on nav
  3. Improve accessibilty (Aria) and button states (focus, hover etc.)
